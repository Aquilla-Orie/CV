                  <h3>Who I am</h3>
                  <p>Gabriel Chukwu is a game developer with limited professional experience but a zeal to learn and improve. His background in the .NET framework, algorithms, and gameplay programming inform his logical approach to problem solving. Gabriel is fueled by his passion for game development, which he strongly believes can be a very powerful tool for impacting lives. He considers himself as a 'life-long learner,' even though he has no intentions to build upon his academic foundation in Computer Science through continued coursework, but rather self learning and professional development.</p>
